Organization for order book:

- gRPC server to recieve orders to match from matching service
    - Create a .proto file that has a service with a req/res relationship
        - define the req/res as Orders (check diagram)

    - Create a class that implements the generated server interface
        - Class should implement the RPC method calls and update the req/res pointers

    - Look how to multi thread per request

- Order book data structure
    - Create a lock free skip list of available, unfilled orders
    - Allow for concurrent searches by different threads
    - Look how to implement and improve the probabilistic nature of the skiplist
